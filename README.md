My name is Benjamin (Ben) Mezger, a software engineer lost in a world of code and numbers. \
I am a graduate computer scientist interested in open source, operating systems, and computer architecture. \
I am currently studying for a master's in fault-tolerant operating systems in RISC-V.

I write posts and keep notes in my [personal blog](https://seds.nl). \
If you are interested in my professional career, check out my [CV](https://seds.nl/files/Benjamin_Mezger_CV.pdf). \
On IRC, I go with the nick _seds_, specifically in [@libera.chat](https://libera.chat/), [@freenode](https://freenode.net/) and [@darkscience](https://darkscience.net/).
