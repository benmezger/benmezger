My name is Benjamin Mezger, a software engineer lost in a world of code and numbers. \
I am a graduate computer scientist interested in open source, operating systems, and computer architecture. \
I am currently studying for a master's in multicore and fault-tolerant systems in RISC-V.

I enjoy writing posts and publishing my notes in my [blog](https://seds.nl). \
If you are interested in my professional career, check out my [CV](https://seds.nl/files/Benjamin_Mezger_CV.pdf). \
On IRC, I go with the nick _seds_, specifically in [@freenode](https://freenode.net/) and [@darkscience](https://darkscience.net/).
